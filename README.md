# 📄 Research Paper Starter Template (Code + LaTeX)

Welcome to the **Research Paper Starter Template**! This repository is designed to streamline the workflow of writing academic papers (specifically targeted at IEEE conferences/journals, but adaptable) while managing the associated experimental code.

It provides a clean separation of concerns:
*   **`code/`**: For your Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), and experimental data.
*   **`paper/`**: For your LaTeX manuscript, modularized for easy collaboration and maintenance.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Modular LaTeX Structure**: The main paper is split into logical sections (`introduction.tex`, `methodology.tex`, etc.) in the `paper/sections/` folder.
*   **Cross-Platform Build Script**: A Python-based build script (`paper/build.py`) that handles the full LaTeX compilation cycle (`pdflatex` -> `bibtex` -> `pdflatex`) automatically. Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   **Smart Compilation**: The build script checks if your PDF is locked (open in a viewer) and waits for you to close it before retrying, preventing common write errors.
*   **Clean Repository**: configured `.gitignore` to keep your repo free of LaTeX build artifacts (`.aux`, `.log`, etc.).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**: Required for the build script and experimental code.
2.  **LaTeX Distribution**:
    *   **Windows**: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Recommended) or TeX Live.
    *   **macOS**: [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
    *   **Linux**: TeX Live (`sudo apt install texlive-full`).

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Writing the Paper
Navigate to `paper/sections/` and edit the individual `.tex` files.
*   `sections/introduction.tex`
*   `sections/methodology.tex`
*   etc.

The `main.tex` file acts as the skeleton. You mostly won't need to touch it unless you are adding new packages or changing the overall layout.

### 2. Building the PDF
Forget about complex terminal commands. We have a script for that.

1.  Open your terminal in the project root.
2.  Run the build script:
    ```bash
    python paper/build.py
    ```
3.  The script will:
    *   Check if `main.pdf` is locked/open.
    *   Run `pdflatex` (generation 1).
    *   Run `bibtex` (citation linking).
    *   Run `pdflatex` twice more (cross-reference resolution).
    *   Output the final `main.pdf`.

### 3. working with Code
The `code/` directory is a standard Python project.
*   Define dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
*   Place your Jupyter notebooks and scripts here.
*   (Optional) configure your code to save generated plots/figures directly to `../paper/generated/` so your paper updates automatically when you rerun experiments!
